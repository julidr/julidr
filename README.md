Hello 👋

My name is Juliana Diaz, I'm a software engineer with mostly experience in backend using languages as java and python, but with good attitude to learn other approaches outside my comfort zone.

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I'm passionate about my hobbies, that are related to videogames and some animated series, so I tend to do silly projects based on them.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Coding, videogames, anime, series...anything really.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on: ##

[Kuro-bot](https://github.com/julidr/kuro-bot) a Discord bot that offers basic information about [Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Re Live](https://www.en.revuestarlight-relive.com/) gatcha game. Like the stage girls birthday and events reminders.

On more serious issues, I am currently working as a developer for [PayU Latam](https://colombia.payu.com/en/home/).
